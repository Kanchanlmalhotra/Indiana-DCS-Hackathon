# Indiana-DCS-Hackathon
Indiana Department of Child Services (DCS) substantiates approximately 8% of assessments with child abuse or neglect allegations (with a large amount of false positives). Allegations are called into the Indiana Centralized Hotline 24 hours a day. 121,726 reports of allegations were screened in for assessment by a DCS family case manager in 2019 with the average length of an assessment being 40 days and response times for reports ranging from 2 hours to 5 days. Reduced false positives and more targeted investigation will significantly help achieve more effectiveness of Child Services, reduce the burden on a highly constrained workforce and internal resources and significantly reduce or avoid unnecessary stress put on children and families. 

I have performed Exploratory data analysis, data analysis in Python and data visualization Tableau to derive insights from the data.
